# Multilingual Speech Datasets

This repository is a collection of real-world speech recordings. The datasets are designed for speech quality and intellgibility assessment purposes, including subjective tests in laboratory or crowdsourced settings.

## Speech Intelligibility Assessment

We provide audio files for the Diagnostic Rhyme Test (DRT) to assess speech intelligibility in several languages.
