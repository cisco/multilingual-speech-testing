# Supplementary Materials for ICASSP 2024 submission

We here provide the test scores for the intelligibility tests reported in [1]. We report aggregated scores per test item (an audio file with a corresponding word pair). Details of the calculation of the score and the test procedure are provided in [1].
We further intend to add the processed audio files for all conditions in the experiments in the near future.
